# 🧑‍💻 Personal Portfolio Website  

Welcome to my personal portfolio — a digital space showcasing my **skills, projects, education, and passion for web development**.  
Built with **React (via Vite)**, this portfolio reflects both my technical growth and my creative side as an aspiring **Full-Stack Web Developer**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose  

The goal of this portfolio is to serve as both a **dynamic résumé** and a **personal showcase**.  
It highlights my academic background, technical skillset, and projects that demonstrate my learning journey as a third-year Information Systems student.  

> 💡 This portfolio is designed not only to present my work but also to share my story — how I create, learn, and grow in tech.
